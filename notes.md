# Notes

## Datasets:

* [RML emotion database](http://www.rml.ryerson.ca/rml-emotion-database.html): promising, although maybe a bit small, could go well with another corpus.

* [Montreal affected voices corpus](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18522064): emotional vocalizations (laughing, crying etc.)


#### The ones below I looked at, but were not useful

* [buckeye corpus](http://buckeyecorpus.osu.edu/): Long conversations of
american english - not much metadata

* [voxforge](http://www.voxforge.org/): Lots of recordings, none of it about
the users emotions/stress levels, therefore likely not to have much range.

*   [Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American
English](http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/research/santa-barbara-corpus):
detailed but with no stress/emotion.

*   [Spoken Language Corpora at the Research Center on
Multilingualism](http://www.corpora.uni-hamburg.de/sfb538/en_overview.html):
same as the UCSB

*   [The Spoken Turkish Corpus at METU Ankara](http://std.metu.edu.tr/en/): Also normal corpus

*   [Spoken Corpus Klient with the Corp-Oral Corpus at ILTEC
Lisbon](http://www.iltec.pt/spock/)

*   [OLAC: Open Language Archives
Community](http://www.language-archives.org/)

*   [BAS Bavarian Archive for Speech
Signals](http://www.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/Bas/BasHomeeng.html)

*   [Simmortel Speech Recognition Corpus for Indian English and
Hindi](http://www.simmortel.com/speech-recognition-corpus/)

*   [ELRA: the European Language Resources Association](http://www.elra.info/)

*   [The PELCRA Conversational Corpus of Polish](http://spokes.clarin-pl.eu/)
